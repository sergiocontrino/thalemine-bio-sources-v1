def: "A plant structure (PO:0009011) that is grown or maintained in vitro." [POC:curators]
comment: In vitro growth is defined as microbe-free growth in a sterile, culture environment, usually in the laboratory. An example of a sterile culture environment is growth on or in a nutrient medium in a Petri dish, culture flask or test tube. Microbes may be intentionally added to the culture environment, such as in co-culture with Agrobacterium.
